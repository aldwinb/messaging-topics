# messaging-topics #

A sample publish-subscribe microservice ecosystem that uses topics. It uses RabbitMQ as its message broker.

### How do I run the ecosystem? ###

```
bash simulation.bash
```

This is going to start publish-subscribe simulation (using Docker containers).
It only publishes 1 message at the moment, and then stop the simulation. Logs can be
viewed in the stopped Docker containers.
